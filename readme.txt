Dear Respective Teacher,

This is the code for my Computer Science NEA, it should be as simple as running the code to get it to work. I have created a user interface for you to use when the code is run. The code also works in app form however i was not allowed to upload the app to the android Playstore due to copyright issues (as i am screen scraping information).

Therefore if you would like to get the app version then I have attatched the android.txt file which you will need to attach with the SmartChef.py file and the dishes.txt file and then upload onto your phone using a USB cable and the kivy App.

Furthermore please make sure that you are running your shell on a path that links to the dishes.txt file in case it does not work.

Thanks very much for everything,
